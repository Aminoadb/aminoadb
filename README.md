Amino Acids Database
AminoADB is a comprehensive open-access database on amino acids - proteins' fundamental molecular building blocks. Search and explore in-depth data on all 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids and many non-proteinogenic and modified amino acids.

Discover chemical/physical (computed and experimental) properties, biosynthesis pathways, natural sources, biochemical reactions and pathways, bioactivities, safety profiles, and literature references. AminoADB integrates data from leading public resources and literature into a powerful, user-friendly knowledge platform for research, education, and applications across life sciences.

AminoADB constantly expands its amino acid data and enhances its features for an optimal user experience. Keep visiting for the latest updates!

The database is freely accessible on the web via [aminoadb.org.](https://aminoadb.org/) 


# The Need for a Specific Amino Acids Database (AminoADB)
AminoADB serves as a centralized repository of detailed information on both standard proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids, benefiting researchers, educators, and students by consolidating data fundamental to numerous biological processes. By integrating information from multiple reputable sources, AminoADB enhances research efficiency and accuracy, reducing the time and effort required to gather data from disparate locations. It provides comprehensive coverage, including chemical and physical properties, biosynthesis pathways, natural sources, biochemical reactions, bioactivities, and safety profiles, thus offering a holistic understanding of amino acids in one place. For educational purposes, AminoADB acts as a powerful teaching tool, enriching students' knowledge of biochemistry and molecular biology through user-friendly and interactive features. Additionally, it supports drug development and biomedical research by offering detailed insights into amino acid properties and interactions, which are critical for developing new therapeutics and advancing pharmaceutical applications.
